# Dot Target
Dot Target is a simple game about shooting on red targets.

You have 4 different difficulties: Easy, Normal, Hard and Extreme.

**Easy**
1 target appears every 2,5 seconds

**Normal**
1 target appears every 1 second
Conventional mode, the game starts automatically with this mode

**Hard**
1 target appears every 0,75 (3 quarters of a second) seconds

**Extreme** _(almost impossible)_
1 target appears every 0,5 (a half of a second) seconds

The game itself don't have an objective, so you cannot "lose".
Hard and Extreme modes are very difficult to let less than 2 or 3 targets on the screen.
